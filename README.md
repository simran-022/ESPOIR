INTRODUCTION:

We all know that humans have been inhabiting this earth for a long time. Over time, times have changed and humans have evolved. The world became developed and so did mankind. Each generation has seen new changes and things that the older generations have not. This is exactly what creates a generation gap. It is how one generation differs from the other. It is quite natural for a generation gap to exist. Why? 
Because it shows that mankind is evolving and changing for the better. However, sometimes this gap impacts our lives wrongly. A generation gap happens due to the constant changes in the world. While we may not stop the evolvement of the world, we can strengthen the bond and bridge the gap it creates. 
No one can end this generation gap but obviously, can opt for some way in which it can be reduced. There should be efforts made by both sides to get a better relationship between two people.
Having our elders with us in our family is a greatest blessing and to protect this blessing our team came up with a solution i.e. ESPOIR. A website where older generation can learn about the new trends going on and the younger generation can learn about how to obey and take care of their elders. Both the generations can also interact with each other and find solutions to their requirements and learn more about their views and ideologies.
