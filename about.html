            <p class="text">
                We all know that humans have been inhabiting this earth for a long time. Over time, times have changed and humans have evolved. The world became developed and so did mankind. Each generation has seen new changes and things that the older generations have not. This is exactly what creates a generation gap. It is how one generation differs from the other. It is quite natural for a generation gap to exist. We can bridge the generation gap by creating a safe environment for people to express themselves. This website will be very helpful for everyone to get to know about the latest technologies as well as to share each otherâ€™s problem. We must understand and accept each other for what they are rather than fitting them in a box. "Love and understanding are the best antidotes to this ever-widening generation gap".
