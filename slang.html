                    <p>It's still a prominent luxury Italian fashion brand, but for most teens, gucci is synonymous with good, cool or fine (as in, "it's all gucci).</p>

                    <h2>SHOOK </h2>
                    <p>Shook is a way to describe that you are emotionally shaken or affected by something. You might hear your teen say, “I stayed up all night reading that book, and now I am shook.”</p>

                    <p>These are two different ways to express what you might have meant by saying "dope" or "neat" or "cool" back in the day. Lit or GOAT (greatest of all time) means something happened that is really, really good.</p>

                    <p>A hotly contested one, this term is used to refer to someone who does “way too much” for someone they like or are fond of. So someone who is being overly sappy towards another person to win their affections be called a “simp”.</p>

                    <p>Essentially something that you're very good at, hence making you the CEO of it. This is a big one on Tiktok and is commonly a comment on what someone did in the video.></p>

                    <h2>PERIODT</h2>
                    <p>Think of this as the teen's version of her parent's "Because I said so," as in, no further questions, end of discussion. It can also add emphasis to a previous statement through the phrasing, "(and) that's on periodt." Remember Kanye's infamous spotlight grab during Taylor Swift's 2009 VMA acceptance? In 2021, he'd likely throw in a periodt to his claim that Beyonce was robbed of Album of the Year.</p>

                    <h2>LOWKEY</h2>
                    <p>This is a way to describe something you want to keep on the down-low, to use one of our old slang words, or something that you don't want to emphasize too much. For instance: “I lowkey can't wait for this school year to be over… not that I'm mentioning this to my parents.”</p>
